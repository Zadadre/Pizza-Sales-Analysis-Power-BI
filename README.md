## About
The Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard is a visualization of sales data obtained from a dataset called `pizza_sales`. The dataset was initially in CSV format and was uploaded to a MySQL server for analysis. The analysis involved extracting insights such as the number of sales on different days of the week by transforming the datetime format. The data was then connected to Power BI for further analysis and visualization.

## Key Features
- **Data Import and Transformation**: The CSV dataset was imported into a MySQL database, and data transformation was performed to extract relevant information such as days of the week and sales quantities.
- **Connection to Power BI**: Power BI was connected to the MySQL database to access the cleaned and transformed data.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Further data cleaning was performed in Power BI, including extracting month and day information from dates and creating additional columns for analysis.
- **Dashboard Creation**: A comprehensive dashboard was created using Power BI, visualizing key metrics and insights derived from the sales data.
- **Sales by Day of the Week**: Visualizes the number of sales on each day of the week.
- **Sales by Month**: Analyzes sales data based on different months.
- **Total Sales**: Displays the total sales figures.
- **Average Sales per Day**: Provides insights into the average daily sales.
- **Sales Trends**: Examines sales trends over time.
